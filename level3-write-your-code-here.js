/*
    Implement the function `level3Move` below so that the prince can
    reach his beloved princess.

    The 'level3Move' should return an array with a mixture of the words
    'left', 'right', 'up' or 'down'. These words will then be passed as
    parameters to the `moveDirection` function (you do not have access to
    this function in this level).

    The map changes from level to level BUT you have a representation of
    it through the variables `gameMap`.

    HINT: use the BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS.
*/

function level3Move(gameMap) {
    console.dir(gameMap);
    return ['down', 'down', 'down'];
}
